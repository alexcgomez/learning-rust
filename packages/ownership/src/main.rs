    x and y are shallow copied, not deeply copied, and we donâ€™t have a call to clone explicitly.
    The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are
    stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make.

    Simple scalars implement the Copy trait, meaning that since their memory layout is fixed
    and known at compile time, they can be copied efficiently in the stack without requiring
    heap allocation.

    Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple, as shown in Listing 4-5.

    Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for using a value without transferring ownership,
    called references.
