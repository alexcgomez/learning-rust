# RUST - Programming Language

## What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that is focused on three things: safety, speed, and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages arenâ€™t good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems.


## Features of Rust

- Zero-cost abstractions
- Move semantics
- Guaranteed memory safety
- Threads without

## Installation

To install Rust, if you are using Linux or macOS, you can use the following in your terminal:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
